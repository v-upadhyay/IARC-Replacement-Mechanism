# IARC-Replacement-Mechanism

> Hi there folks, the code that you see above was used in IARC Mission 9 hardware Challenge for a replacement Mechanism made by team UMIC. Basically you have to replace a communication module on an tower with a new one, so we needed some kind of mechanism to do it and we came with an amazing solution. Soon, UMIC will also upload the video of the replacement mechanism on their youtube channel. So subscribe now.
> 
> UMIC is a students based team formed by students of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. We mainly focuses on Autonomous Cars and UAVs. So we have two divisons:
>
> i. Aerove: For Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
> 
> ii. Sedrica : For Self Driving Cars.
